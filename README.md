# ❤️ End-to-End Heart Disease Prediction Project

This repository contains an **end-to-end machine learning project** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health data.  
The project is implemented in Python using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn**.

## 📖 Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment and survival rates.  
This project demonstrates how to build, train, evaluate, and compare machine learning models to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.

The workflow includes:
1. Loading and exploring the dataset  
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
3. Training multiple machine learning models  
4. Evaluating model performance using various metrics  
5. Visualizing results (ROC curve, confusion matrix, feature importance)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**, which contains **303 patient records** and **14 features**, such as:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Cholesterol levels  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- ST depression and slope  
- Number of major vessels (ca)  
- Thalassemia (thal)  

The **target variable** is:
- `0` → No heart disease  
- `1` → Presence of heart disease
